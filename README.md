# Documentation

## Introduction
This plugin uses the Hubitat's Maker API and websockets to allow Stream Deck to control devices.

## Setup

### Hubitat

Make note of your `API_URL` and your `access_token`. ![](resources/readme/access_token.png)

### Stream Deck

#### Available Buttons
There are currently two buttons available
* Toggle Switch - This will toggle the state of a switch from off to on, or on to off.
* Set Switch - This will set the state of a switch to either on or off, regardless of its current state.

Drag an action button to a free button slot. Configure the button with the `API URL` of your hubitat. Paste in your `access_token` from the Maker API.
Click away from the input field and if everything has been setup properly, the list of devices should populate. Select the device you want to control and give it a name.
